    <h2 style="color:#8B0000;">About the Ministries</h2>
    <p>Rev. Ezra Venkatesh started a small church with only two members in the year 2003 at Rajapalayam. By the grace of God, gradually the church started growing.</p>
    
    <p>As Rev. Ezra preached the word of faith, God made him understand the gospel of grace. He began to preach the unconditional love and favour of God. One night Rev. Ezra had a personal encounter with the Lord Jesus. The Lord asked him, "Will you stand firm and preach this gospel of grace despite the opposition from certain groups of people?" Ezra answered Him that he would preach this gospel of grace even if all the congregation members were to desert him. This personal encounter with God transformed his life and ministry.</p>

    <p>After knowing the heart of God and getting a mandate from Him, he started preaching the truth about grace without attempting to balance or mix it with the law. The Gospel of Grace is the foundation of this "New Covenant Ministries".</p>

    <p>Now Rev. Ezra is pastoring two congregations in two places namely Srivilliputtur and Rajapalayam in Tamil Nadu. In every service people enjoy God's presence and His unconditional love. In every Sunday service Holy Communion is served in remembrance of the Lord Jesus with thanksgiving. For children, Sunday school is held simultaneously during church services. Every year Vacation Bible School is held during summer holidays.</p>

    <p>You are welcome to our church services.</p>
