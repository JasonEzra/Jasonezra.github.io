        <h2>Rev. Ezra Venkatesh</h2>
        
        <p>Rev. Ezra Venkatesh was born and brought up in a Hindu family. Though He was like a sheep going astray, it was God's pleasure to reveal His Son in him.</p>
        
        <p>After his studies he was working in a company. Having many friends, getting a salary, making merry, everything was going well outwardly. But in his heart, he had many questions like, Why am I here in this earth? What is the purpose of my life? Who has made me live here? He felt emptiness and loneliness in his heart. None of his religious rituals could give peace. As he was searching for the truth he went to a church and came to know about Jesus Christ. Jesus became the answer for all his questions. The thirsty soul was satisfied with divine love and peace.</p>
        
        <p>After few years of his Christian walk, he felt that he had a definite call of God for ministry. So, he resigned his job and joined a Bible college. Now God is leading him in every step of his life and in the ministry.</p>
        
        <p>Rev.Ezra is a good teacher and all his teachings are based on the New covenant and the finished work at the Cross.</p>
        
        <p>Pastor Ezra found Ruby as his help meet, who had already yielded to God's call at her young age. As a virtuous woman she is the crown of Ezra. They are blessed with two sons Jason Ezra and Jerome Ezra.</p>
